/*
The changes made to original PBRT code include:
-Removed all the intermediary steps involved in building a BVH. 
We now directly compute the cache-friendly BVH which results in quite some speedup
in build since we're not even allocating memory and also  jumping through 32 byte nodes is faster
-Streamlining certain operations/data that were general in PBRT. Some of which:
PrimitiveInfo, Primitives only as triangles. Placing into buckets & SAH code is simpler with less edge cases
for number of primitives, memory arena was removed
-Code is heavily commented, which may prove useful for future implementers.
-More explicit parameters you can tweak for SAH. Like:
Cost per node traversal and cost per triangle intersection, bucketNumber, max primitives in a node

Thus it is now less general, but simpler and faster to build.
